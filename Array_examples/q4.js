// Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove all duplicates in-place so that each unique element appears only once.



// Return the number of unique elements in the array.



// If the number of unique elements be k, then,

// Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the unique values in the order that they were present originally.
// The remaining elements, as well as the size of the array does not matter in terms of correctness.
// The driver code will assess correctness by printing and checking only the first k elements of the modified array.


// An array sorted in non-decreasing order is an array where every element to the right of an element is either equal to or greater in value than that element.

// console.log(removeDuplicates([0, 0, 3, 3, 5, 6]))
